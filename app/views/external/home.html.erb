               <p> Maternal health is the health of women during pregnancy,
                  childbirth, and the postnatal period while children’s health is
                  the extent to which children can thrive, satisfy
                  their needs, and develop the capacities that allow them to
                  interact successfully with their environments. Maternal and
                  child health is the overlap and interaction between the
                  development, needs, and health of both the mother and child.
